## My process

### Built with

    - HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript
    - Google Fonts and Font Awesome for styling and icons
    - Responsive Design Principles
    - Local Storage for managing watchlist data
    - Fetch API for accessing movie data

### What I learned

In this project, titled "Movie-Watchlist" I dove into the complexities of API integration and dynamic content management in web applications. The journey was both challenging and enlightening, significantly enhancing my skills in several areas.

API Integration Challenge: One of the primary challenges was figuring out how to retrieve specific data from the movie API. This task tested my ability to understand and navigate API documentation, making efficient API requests, and handle JSON data.

Dynamic Watchlist Management: Adding and removing movies from the watchlist posed a significant challenge. This feature required a deep understanding of JavaScript's array methods and DOM manipulation. Implementing this functionality was a rewarding process that sharpened my skills in managing dynamic content on web pages.

Practical API Usage: This project served as an excellent platform for practicing API integration in a real-world application. I learned how to make asynchronous requests, handle API responses, and dynamically render the retrieved data onto the webpage.

### Continued development

Moving forward, I aim to further refine my skills in API integration and explore more advanced JavaScript and CSS techniques to enhance user experience. I'm particularly interested in implementing more complex features like pagination for search results and advanced state management for dynamic content.
